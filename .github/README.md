A centralized repository for managing notification service configurations for my homelab. This project aims to provide ready-to-use configurations for various services, making it easier to set up and maintain notifications across different applications.

## üìñ About The Project

In a homelab environment, having a reliable notification system is crucial for monitoring services, receiving alerts, and staying informed about system health. This repository contains configurations for popular notification services that can be integrated with various applications like monitoring tools, automation scripts, and more.

The goal is to have a single source of truth for these configurations, making them easy to update, share, and deploy.

### Services Covered

Currently, this repository includes configurations for:

* **[Mailgun](https://www.mailgun.com/)**: An email automation service.
* **[SMTP2GO](https://www.smtp2go.com/)**: An SMTP provider for sending emails.
* _(More to come!)_

## üöÄ Getting Started

To use these configurations, you can clone the repository and adapt the files to your specific needs. Most configurations will require you to input your own API keys, domain names, and other sensitive information.

<!-- **Example Usage:**

_This section is a placeholder. You can add specific examples of how to integrate these configurations with tools like `ntfy`, `Prometheus Alertmanager`, or custom scripts._

```bash
# Example of how a user might integrate a configuration
# This is just a conceptual example
cp mailgun/config.yaml /path/to/your/application/
# Remember to replace placeholder values in the config file!
``` -->
